    <h1>Things: a Story of The Sixties</h1>
    <h3>A 1965 Novel -By: George Perec</h3>
    
    <br><br>
    <p1>Your eye, <br>
        first of all, <br>
        would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor. <br>
        Its walls would be cupboards, in light-colored wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. <br>
        <br>Three prints, depicting, respectively, <br>
        the Derby winner Thunderbird, <br>
        a paddle-steamer named Ville­de-Motitereau, <br>
        and a Stephenson locomotive, <br>
        would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which would slide back at the merest touch. <br>
        <br>There, the	carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, partly covered by three faded rugs.</p1>
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p2>It would be <br>
        a living room <br>
        about twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide. <br>
        <br>On the left, <br>
        in a kind of recess, there would be a large sofa upholstered in worn black leather, <br>
        with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, <br>
        heaped with books in untidy piles. <br>
        <br>Above the sofa, <br>
        a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. <br>
        <br>On the other side of a small low table, <br>
        and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, <br>
        there would be another sofa, <br>
        at right angles to the first, with a light-brown velvet covering; <br>
        <br>It would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for knick-knacks: <br>
        agates and stone eggs, <br>
        snuffboxes, <br>
        candy-boxes, <br>
        jade ashtrays, <br>
        a mother-of-pearl oyster shell, <br>
        a silver fob watch, <br>
        a cut-glass glass, <br>
        a crystal pyramid, <br>
        a miniature in an oval frame.</p2>
        
    <br><br><br>
        <p3>Further on, <br>
            beyond a padded door, <br>
            <br>there would be shelving on both sides of the comer, <br>
            for caskets and for records, <br>
            beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined­ steel knobs would be visible, <br>
            and above it, <br>
            a print <br>
            depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. <br>
            <br>Through the window, <br>
            draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, you would glimpse <br>
            a few trees, <br>
            a tiny park, <br>
            a bit of street. <br>
            A roll­ top desk littered with papers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. <br>
            On a console table would be a telephone, a leather diary, a writing pad. <br>
            <br>Then, <br>
            on the other side of another door, <br>
            beyond a low, square revolving bookcase <br>
            supporting a large, cylindrical vase <br>
            decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, <br>
            set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, <br>
            there would be a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the leather curtain.</p3>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p4>It would be all in browns, <br>
        ochres, <br>
        duns <br>
        and yellows: <br>
        a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some striking, <br>
        brighter splashes--- <br>
        a cushion in almost garish orange, a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. <br>
        <br>During the day, <br>
        the light flooding in would make this room <br>
        seem a little sad, <br>
        despite the roses. <br>
        <br>It would be an evening room. <br>
        <br>But in the winter, <br>
        with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated--- <br>
        the bookcase comer, <br>
        the record shelves, <br>
        the desk, <br>
        the low table between the two settees, <br>
        and the vague reflections in the mirror--- <br>
        and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam--- <br>
        the polished wood, <br>
        the rich, <br>
        heavy silks, <br>
        the cut glass, <br>
        the softened leather--- <br>
        <br>It would be a haven of  peace, a land of happiness.</p4>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p5>The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. <br>
        <br>An English double bed would fill the whole rear part of it. <br>
        <br>On the right, <br>
        to both sides of the window, <br>
        there would be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, <br>
        to be read and read again, <br>
        photograph  albums, <br>
        packs of cards, <br>
        pots, <br>
        necklaces, <br>
        paste jewellery. <br>
        <br>To the left, <br>
        an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood and brass <br>
        would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table.<br>
        <br>Through a half-open door giving on to <br>
        a bathroom <br>
        <br>you would glimpse thick bathrobes, <br>
        swan-neck taps in solid brass, <br>
        a large adjustable mirror, <br>
        a pair of cut­ throat razors and their green leather sheaths, <br>
        bottles, <br>
        horn-handled brushes, <br>
        sponges. <br>
        <br>The bedroom walls <br>
        would be papered with chintz; <br>
        the bedspread <br>
        would be a tartan blanket. <br>
        A bedside table, <br>
        with an openwork copper band running round three of its sides, <br>
        would support a silver candlestick lamp topped with a very pale grey silk shade, <br>
        a square carriage clock, <br>
        a rose in a stem-vase, <br>
        and, on its lower shelf, <br>
        folded newspapers and some magazines. <br>
        <br>Further on, <br>
        at the foot of the bed, <br>
        there would be a big pouf in natural hide. <br>
        <br>At the window, <br>
        the gauze curtains would slide on brass rods; the thick woollen double curtains would be half drawn. <br>
        In  the  half­ light the room would still be bright. <br>
        <br>On the wall, <br>
        above the bed made up and turned down for the night, between two small wall lamps, <br>
        the astonishing, <br>
        long, <br>
        narrow, <br>
        black­-and-white photograph<br>
        of a bird in the sky <br>
        would surprise you <br>
        by its slightly formal perfection.</p5>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p6>The second door would reveal a study.<br>
        <br>From top to bottom <br>
        the walls <br>
        would be lined with books and periodicals with, here and there, so <br>
        as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, <br>
        a number of prints, <br>
        drawings <br>
        and photographs--- <br>
        Antonello da Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of Saint George, <br>
        one of Piranesi's dungeons, <br>
        a portrait by Ingres, <br>
        a little pen-and-ink landscape by Klee, <br>
        a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room at the College de France, a Steinberg department store, <br>
        Cranach's Melanchthon--- <br>
        pinned to wooden panels set into  the  shelving. <br>
        <br>Slightly to the left of the window and at a shallow angle would be a long country table covered with a large red blotter. <br>
        Wooden boxes, <br>
        flat pen-holders <br>
        and pots of all kinds would hold pencils, <br>
        paper-clips, <br>
        staples large and small. <br>
        A glass tile would serve as an ashtray. <br>
        A circular black leather box decorated with gold-leaf arabesques would be filled with cigarettes. <br>
        Light would come from an old desk-lamp, adjustable only with difficulty, fitted with a green opaline lampshade shaped like a visor. <br>
        On each side of the table, <br>
        virtually facing each other, <br>
        would be two high-backed wood and leather armchairs. <br>
        <br>Still further to the left, <br>
        along the wall, would be a narrow table overflowing with books. <br>
        A wing-chair in bottle-green leather <br>
        would lead to grey metal filing cabinets and light wooden card-index boxes. <br>
        <br>On a third, even smaller table <br>
        would be a Swedish lamp and a typewriter under its canvas dust-cover. <br>
        Right at the back <br>
        would be a narrow bed covered in ultramarine velvet and stacked with cushions of all colours. <br>
        <br>On a painted wooden stand, <br>almost in the middle of the room, <br>there would be a globe made of papier-mâché and nickel silver, illustrated in naïf style, <br>
        a fake antique. <br>
        <br>Behind the desk, <br>
        half-hidden by the red curtain at the window, <br>
        would be an oiled-wood ladder which could slide on a brass rail all the way round the room.</p5>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p7>There, life would be easy, simple. <br>
        <br>All the servitudes, all the problems brought by material existence <br>
        would find a natural solution. <br>
        A cleaning lady would come every morning. <br>
        Every fortnight, <br>
        wine, oil and sugar would be delivered. <br>
        <br>There would be a huge, bright kitchen <br>
        with blue tiles decorated with heraldic emblems, <br>
        three china plates decorated with yellow arabesques in metallic paint, <br>
        cupboards everywhere, <br>
        a handsome whitewood table in the middle with  stools and bench-seats. <br>
        <br>It would be pleasant to come and sit there, <br>
        every morning, <br>
        after a shower, <br>
        scarcely dressed. <br>
        <br>On the table <br>
        there would be a sizeable stoneware butter dish, <br>
        jars of marmalade, <br>
        honey, <br>
        toast, <br>
        grapefruit cut in two. <br>
        <br>It would be early. It would be May, the start of a long summer's day.</p6>
    

    <br><br><br>
    <p8>They <br>
        would open the mail, <br>
        they <br>
        would open the newspapers. <br>
        They <br>
        would light their first cigarette. <br>
        They <br>
        would go out. <br>
        <br>Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning. <br>
        <br>They <br>
        would meet for lunch, <br>
        a sandwich or a steak, <br>
        according to their mood; <br>
        they <br>
        would have coffee at a street cafe <br>
        and then go home, on foot, <br>
        slowly.</p8>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p9>Their flat would rarely be tidy, <br>
        but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm. <br>
        <br>They <br>
        would hardly bother themselves with it: <br>
        they <br>
        would live in it. <br>
        <br>The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be an established fact, <br>
        a datum, <br>
        a state of their nature. <br>
        Their attention would be elsewhere: <br>
        on the book they would open, <br>
        on the text they would draft, <br>
        on the record they would isten to, <br>
        on their dialogue engaged afresh each day. <br>
        <br>They would work for a long while. <br>
        Then they would dine, <br>
        or go out for dinner; <br>
        they <br>
        would see old friends; <br>
        they <br>
        would walk together.</p9>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p10>Sometimes <br>
        it would seem to them that <br>
        <br>a whole life could be led harmoniously <br>
        <br>between these book-lined walls, <br>
        amongst these objects <br>
        <br>so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for their sole use. <br>
        <br>But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: <br>
        on some days, <br>
        they would go off on a chance  adventure. <br>
        <br>No plan seemed impossible to them. <br>
        <br>They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy. <br>
        <br>For their means and their desires would always match in all ways. <br>
        <br>They would call this balance happiness and, <br>
        with their freedom, <br>
        with their wisdom and their culture, <br>
        <br>they <br>
        would know <br>
        how to retain <br>
        and to reveal it <br>
        in every moment of their living, <br>
        together.</p9>
