      This is his and her story. But later it becomes their story. Xu, born in
      1969 in Ningbo, Zhejiang. He received his Batchelor of Finance Degree at
      Zhejiang Province University at age of 23. Zhang, born in 1972 in
      Shaoxing, Zhejiang, received her Batchelor of English Degree at Zhejiang
      Wanli College at age of 20. With a common interest in finance and
      economics, Xu and Zhang both entered the Bank of China after graduation.
      This Chinese couple met each other with full of love and, luckily, stepped
      into the palace of marriage in 1997 with faith and persistence. Zhang’s
      first pregnancy ended up with abortion due to her unaware medicine intake;
      soon, Zhang got her second pregnancy and gave birth to a female, weighed
      3.25kg, on July 7th, 1999, named Shuming. Unlike common Chinese parents,
      Xu and Zhang followed the education methodology that kids should be
      allowed to choose their future. With full supports and freedom, Shuming
      decided to follow her own passion in art and design and go to Parsons
      School of Design as a Fashion Design major; but soon she realized her real
      passion and strength in graphics and user interactions; hence she dropped
      from Fashion and declared her major Communication In-teraction Design.
