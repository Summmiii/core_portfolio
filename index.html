    <p1>Your eye, first of all, would glide over the grey fitted carpet	in	the narrow, long	 and high-ceilinged corridor.	 Its walls would be cupboards, in light-colored wood, 1th fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, depicting, respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named VilleÂ­de-Motitereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would  lead to a leather curtain hanging	 on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which would slide back at the merest touch. There, the	carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, partly covered by three faded rugs.</p1>
