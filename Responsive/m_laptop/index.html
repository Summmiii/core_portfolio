        My friend has deuteranomaly, meaning he can see all colors but not green, which will 
        turn yellowish in his eyes. Color weakness leads to unusual color selection in daily attire. 
        But they can’t see the unusualness. This makes me think about color normality in fashion. What
        is normal? "
