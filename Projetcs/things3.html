      >Your eye, <br />
      first of all, <br />
      would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the narrow, long and
      high-ceilinged
      <h2 id="corridor">C<br />O<br />R<br />R<br />I<br />D<br />O<br />R</h2>
      <ol>
        Derby winner Thunderbird,
        <br />
        Ville足de-Motitereau,
        <br />
        Stephenson locomotive,
        <br />
        would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden
        rings which would slide back at the merest touch.
        <br />
      </ol>

      <br />There, the carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock
      floor, partly covered by three faded rugs.</p1

    <br /><br /><br /><br />
    <p2
      ><br /><br />It would be <br />
      <h2 id="livingroom">

      </h2>

      about twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide. <br />
      <br />On the left, <br />
      in a kind of recess, there would be a large
      <h2 id="sofa">S<br />O<br />F<br />A</h2>
      upholstered in worn black leather, <br />
      with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, <br />
      heaped with books in untidy piles. <br />
      Above the sofa, <br />
      a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall.
      <br />
      <br /><br />On the other side of a

      <br />
      and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed
      brass studs, matching the leather curtain, <br />
      there would be
      <h2 id="sofa2">
        A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R

      </h2>
      <br />
      at right angles to the first, with a light-brown velvet covering; <br />
      <br />It would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture,
      lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for
      knick-knacks: <br /><br />
      <ol>
        agates and stone eggs,
        <br />
        snuffboxes,
        <br />
        candy-boxes,
        <br />
        jade ashtrays,
        <br />
        a mother-of-pearl oyster shell,
        <br />
        a silver fob watch,
        <br />
        a cut-glass glass,
        <br />
        a crystal pyramid,
        <br />
        a miniature in an oval frame.

      >Further on, <br />
      beyond a padded
      <h2 id="door">D<br />O<br />O<br />R</h2>
      there would be shelving on both sides of the comer, <br />
      for caskets and for records, <br />
      beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined足 steel knobs would
      be visible, <br />
      and above it, <br />
      a print <br />
      depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. <br />
      <br />Through the
      <h2 id="window">W<br />I<br />N<br />D<br />O<br />W</h2>
      draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper,
      you would glimpse <br />
      <ol>
        a few trees,
        <br />
        a tiny park,
        <br />
        a bit of street.
        <br />
        A roll足 top desk littered with papers and pen-holders would go with a
        small cane-seated chair.
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />On a console table would be
      <ol>
        <br />
        a telephone,
        <br />
        a leather diary,
        <br />
        a writing pad.
      </ol>
      <br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <p4>
        <br />During the day, <br />
        the light flooding in would make this room <br />
        seem a little sad, <br />
        despite the roses. <br />
        <br />It would be an evening room. <br />
        <br />But in the
        <h2 id="winter">W<br />I<br />N<br />T<br />E<br />R</h2>
        with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated--- <br />
        <ol>
          the bookcase comer,
          <br />
          the record shelves,
          <br />
          the desk,
          <br />
          he low table between the two settees,
        </ol>
        <br />
        and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam---
        <br />
        <ol>
          the polished wood,
          <br />
          the rich,
          <br />
          heavy silks,
          <br />
          the cut glass,
          <br />
          the softened leather---
        </ol>
        <br />
        <br />It would be a haven of peace, a land of happiness.</p4

      <br /><br /><br />
      <p5
        >The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a
        light-coloured fitted carpet. <br />
        <br />An English double bed would fill the whole rear part of it. <br />
        <br />On the right, <br />
        to both sides of the window, <br />
        there would be tall and narrow sets of

          necklaces,

          paste jewellery.
        </ol>
        <br />

        <br /><br />Through a half-open door giving on to a<br />

          B<br />A<br />T<br />H<br />R<br />O<br />O<br />M
        </h2>
        you would glimpse <br />
        <ol>
          thick bathrobes,
          <br />
          swan-neck taps in solid brass,
          <br />
          a large adjustable mirror,
          <br />
          a pair of cut足 throat razors and their green leather sheaths,
          <br />
          bottles,
          <br />
          horn-handled brushes,
          <br />
          sponges.

          From top to bottom <br />
          the walls <br />
          would be lined with books and periodicals with, here and there, so
          <br />
          as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, <br />
          <ol>
            a number of prints,
            <br />
            drawings
            <br />
            and photographs---

            Antonello da Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of
            Saint George,

            one of Piranesi's dungeons,

            a portrait by Ingres,

            a little pen-and-ink landscape by Klee,
