    <strong><h2>From top to bottom</h2></strong> <br />
    the walls <br />
    would be lined with books and periodicals with, here and there, so
    <br />
    as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, <br />

    a number of prints,
    <br />
    drawings
    <br />
    and photographs---
    <br />
    Antonello da Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of Saint
    George,
    <br />
    one of Piranesi's dungeons,
    <br />
    a portrait by Ingres,
    <br />
    a little pen-and-ink landscape by Klee,
    <br />
    a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room at the College de France, a
    Steinberg department store,
    <br />
    Cranach's Melanchthon---

    <br />
    <br />pinned to wooden panels set into the shelving. <br />
