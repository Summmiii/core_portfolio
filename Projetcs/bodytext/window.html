    you
    would glimpse <br />

    a few trees,
    <br />
    a tiny park,
    <br />
    a bit of street.
    <br />
    A rollÂ­ top desk littered with papers and pen-holders would go with a small
    cane-seated chair.

    <br />
    <br />On a console table would be

    <br />
    a telephone,
    <br />
    a leather diary,
    <br />
    a writing pad.

    <br />

    <br />

      <br />During the day, <br />
      the light flooding in would make this room <br />
      seem a little sad, <br />
      despite the roses. <br />
